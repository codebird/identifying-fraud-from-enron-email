ene has cut anoth deal on portland general electr pge this time with northwest natur gas nwn 2304 126 div546 yield the deal size is 2955 billion the origin deal in novemb 1999 was for 31 billion with sierra pacif resourc srp 1512 080 div 529 yield this was 300 mm better than we expect in our septemb 28 report which upgrad ene to a strong buy this deal has veri few extern and should close twelv month henc both compani are oregonbas and should get a better regulatori break than ene did when it bought pge in juli 1997 the impact on ene 1 veri littl gain or loss on sale of the asset 2 interest expens reduct should larg offset expect 140 mm after tax annual pge earn contribut 3 a better balanc sheet with total leverag drop from 619 to 573 if done today this is a step in the right direct pge will be in much better hand to pursu it oregon agenda and ene will look better without pges presenc we continu to rate ene a strong buy up to 36 it becom a buy from 36 to 40 our 12month price target is 4244 current event the deal is straightforward nwn will rais 155 billion in cash 200 mm in felin pride and will issu 50 mm in nwn stock to enron nwn will assum the residu 75 mm oblig inflict on ene by the oregon puc as the price of regulatori peac ie ransom demand at the time of the origin acquisit this bring the total purchas price to 187 billion for pges 1118 billion of common equiti nwn will assum 105 billion of total debt and 29 mm of straight prefer the pricetobook is 167 pge has been earn in the 125 mm140 mm aftertax area although the number may work higher this year 150 mm becaus of fasb 133 marktomarket profit on longerd power trade of 16 mm be realiz so far the approxim pe is about 125x forecast the electr group is now trade at 115x 01es and 109x 02es the regulatori due process should take about 12 month there are no loom rate case roe or capit structur issu the opuc rank veri low among state puc in term of provid fair or competit roe for investor we were pleas to learn that the opuc has final ditch the capm capit asset price model as a worthless relic for determin cost of capit and has embrac discount cash flow methodolog the bad news was that this still didnt prevent the opuc from roll over pge in it august 1 rate case settlement drop the allow roe from 116 to 105 the annual earn impact look like 89 mm aftertax given the veri parochi natur of the oregon retail energi market there is no question in our mind that this should be a worthwhil deal for nwn and a win for ene as well if the deal were close today ene would deleverag to the tune of the 295 billion proceed or from 619 to 573 total leverag it would also trade up ene unnecessarili low composit roe from the 125 area to someth better pges secular growth rate is 34 annual in rate base term and it ebit contribut would run onli 89 of ene total in 20022003 there would be veri littl book gain or loss on the sale and the 14 billion of under goodwil on the pge asset will disappear ene had to reincorpor in oregon at the time of the pge purchas chanc are that it will be a delawar corpor by this time next year on the other hand nwn has seiz a veri good but high leverag opportun both manag are larg in sync cover much of the same ground alreadi the synergi can be meaning nwns asset base would more than tripl from 129 billion to about 565 billion in essenc nwns 840 mm rate base will be join with pges rate base of 165 billion and nwn would have tripl it rate base to 249 billion about 780 mm of goodwil will be creat in the process nwn is fund the deal 98 with debt and a mandatori convert prefer and 2 with common equiti it will set up a new upstream corpor and presum do a section 351 acquisit the two subsidiari will then be merg into newco and that name will be chang back to nwn nwns total capit structur at midyear ran 47936486 total debtpreferredscommon equiti the pro forma structur should run 79769134 if shortterm debt is exclud the structur becom 77975146 each subsidiari of newco will continu with about 4852 leverag but the parent will look more like an lbo is this bad we dont think so becaus 1 nwn is buy 140 mm of earn and may pay out about 85 mm90 mm in aftertax interest expens and thank to fasb 140142 there would be no goodwil amort 2 newco will have almost entir regul asset and 3 the synergi in both ga and om expens should be notic the surplus cffo profit of say 5070 mm can be use to pay down the acquisit debt the good news is that nwns earn should be ramp up signific as a result of this deal the tradeoff may be that this is a onetim event and newco will still be subject to the whim of the opuc this should not be underestim nwns realiz roe have been about 100105 recent and pges have been in the 120125 realiz rang nwn is expect to grow at 56
